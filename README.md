# Movie-Rating-Prediction-Autoencoder

Implemented an Autoencoder model for the movie rating prediction problem, introduced in:

S. Sedhain, A. K. Menon, S. Sanner, and L. Xie. Autorec: Autoencoders meet collaborative filtering.
In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW ’15 Companion,
pages 111–112, Republic and Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, 2015. 

I plan to incorporate movie genre information into this model to facilitate more accurate prediction.
This repository is still a working progress. 

To do:
* Implement Resilent Propagation for optimization.
* Extend model to incorporate movie genre information.
